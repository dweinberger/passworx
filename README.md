html password list with faux crypto

Oy, this is such a terrible idea, and a godawful implementation. You're welcome!

This builds a list of sites and passwords. You have to enter everything manually. 

And the cryptography? Haha. I laugh in the face of crypto. It writes out a local file using a simple algorithm to make it look encrypted: it swaps adjacent characters and adds 3 to their char value. 

So why did I post such a POS at GitHub? I use a slightly more secure version of this written in what used to be called RealBasic. I no longer subscribe to RB. So I wrote the HTML version. It's a GitHub so I won't use it.

I'm so sorry.
