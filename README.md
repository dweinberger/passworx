# passworx - 2015 READ.ME
html password list with faux crypto

Oy, this is such a terrible idea, and a godawful implementation. You're welcome!

This builds a list of sites and passwords. You have to enter everything manually. 

And the cryptography? Haha. I laugh in the face of crypto. It writes out a local file using a simple algorithm to make it look encrypted. 

So why did I post such a POS at GitHub? I use a slightly more secure version of this written in what used to be called RealBasic. I no longer subscribe to RB. So I wrote the HTML version..

I'm so sorry.

# 2018 READ.ME

Pretty much a complete rewrite. It's better, but it's still just as insecure.

Requires the following directories and files:   
 		passworx.html  
 		js/passworx01.js  
 		css/passworx.css  
 		images/static.jpg (screensaver)  
 		includes/\[any recent version of jQuery]  
 		includes/jquery.visible.min.js  
 			\[from https://github.com/customd/jquery-visible]
 		php/makebakefile.php  
 		php/deletesaveddata.php  
 		php/saveConvertedText.php  
 		php/savejson.php  
 		data/  
   
I stand by nothing in this code. I am an amateur. 
Forgive me.
